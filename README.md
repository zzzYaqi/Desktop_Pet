# Desktop_Pet
A desktop pet is a small virtual companion on your screen to keep you company while you work or study.

You can register as a user and log in to your account. Then there will be a pet storage. For now, I set three little pets and you can pick anyone you like.
Then the pet will come to the screen. It has animation and functions such as screenshots, chat and drag.
